# Google Search Clone

This project is a simplified clone of Google Search, featuring basic and advanced search functionalities.

## Overview

The project consists of three HTML files (`index.html`, `images.html`, and `advanced.html`) representing different search interfaces, along with a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling purposes.

### Features

- **Basic Search**: `index.html` provides a basic search interface similar to the main Google search page. Users can input their search query and perform a standard Google search or opt for the "I'm feeling lucky" option.

- **Image Search**: `images.html` offers an image search interface where users can input their search query to find images related to their query.

- **Advanced Search**: `advanced.html` provides an advanced search interface with additional search options, allowing users to refine their search by specifying criteria such as all these words, exact word or phrase, any of these words, and none of these words.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open any of the HTML files (`index.html`, `images.html`, or `advanced.html`) in a web browser to access the respective search interfaces.

3. Enter your search query in the provided input field and click the appropriate button to perform the search.

## Styling

The project includes a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the HTML elements across all pages. The styling aims to replicate the appearance of the Google search interface.

## Files

- **index.html**: Basic search interface.
- **images.html**: Image search interface.
- **advanced.html**: Advanced search interface.
- **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the search interfaces.
